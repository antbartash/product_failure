# Product failure prediction
A company has just completed a large testing study for different product prototypes. Each prototype is used in a simulated real-world environment experiment, and absorbs a certain amount of fluid (loading) to see whether or not it fails. For each product_code there is a number of product attributes as well as a number of measurement values for each individual product, representing various lab testing methods. The aim of the project is to build a model that predicts product failures.
